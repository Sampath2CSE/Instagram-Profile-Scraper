## ‚öôÔ∏è Best Practices

### Rate Limiting
- Use delays of at least 2000ms between requests
- Enable Apify Proxy for better success rates
- Limit concurrent requests to avoid overwhelming Instagram's servers

### Proxy Configuration
- **Residential Proxies**: Best success rate, recommended for production
- **Datacenter Proxies**: Faster but higher chance of blocks
- **Automatic Rotation**: Let Apify handle IP rotation automatically

### Error Handling
- The scraper automatically retries failed requests
- Failed profiles are logged with error details
- Use the dataset to identify and debug issues

## üîß Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Apify SDK**: Platform integration and data handling
- **Crawlee**: Web scraping framework with Puppeteer
- **Puppeteer**: Headless Chrome automation

### Architecture
- Built on Apify's Actor platform
- Uses Puppeteer for reliable browser automation
- Implements smart retry logic and error recovery
- Includes comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Performance
- **Memory Usage**: ~1GB recommended
- **Execution Time**: ~2-5 seconds per profile
- **Concurrency**: Configurable based on requirements
- **Scaling**: Automatically scales on Apify platform

## üö® Important Notes

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Only scrape public profiles that are accessible without login
- Respect Instagram's terms of service and robots.txt
- Use reasonable delays to avoid overwhelming their servers
- Consider implementing additional respect measures for high-volume scraping

### Limitations
- Cannot access private profiles
- Some data may be unavailable due to Instagram's anti-scraping measures
- Success rates may vary based on account popularity and Instagram's current policies

### Troubleshooting
- **High Failure Rates**: Increase delays, enable residential proxies
- **Missing Data**: Some profiles may have restricted data access
- **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout settings or reduce concurrency

## üìà Performance Optimization

### For High-Volume Scraping
1. Use residential proxies exclusively
2. Implement longer delays (3-5 seconds)
3. Run during off-peak hours
4. Split large batches into smaller runs
5. Monitor success rates and adjust accordingly

### Memory Management
- The Actor is optimized for 1GB memory allocation
- For larger batches, consider running multiple smaller instances
- Monitor memory usage in Apify Console

## üÜï Updates and Maintenance

This scraper is designed to be maintainable and adaptable to Instagram's changing structure. Regular updates may be needed to:

- Adapt to new Instagram layouts
- Update selector strategies
- Improve anti-detection measures
- Add new data extraction capabilities

## üìû Support

For issues, questions, or feature requests:
1. Check the Apify Console logs for detailed error information
2. Verify your input configuration matches the schema
3. Test with a small batch first before scaling up
4. Review Instagram's current policies and limitations
